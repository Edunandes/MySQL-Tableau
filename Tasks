## Using MySQL Workbench 


TASK 1 
Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

First step to complete this task was using the MySQL as the code below:

SELECT 
    YEAR(d.from_date) AS calendar_year,
    e.gender,    
    COUNT(e.emp_no) AS num_of_employees
FROM     
     t_employees e         
          JOIN t_dept_emp d ON d.emp_no = e.emp_no
GROUP BY calendar_year , e.gender 
HAVING calendar_year >= 1990;
