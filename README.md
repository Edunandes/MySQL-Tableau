I gained practical skills in creating, designing, and operating SQL databases using MySQL. Through hands-on practice, I developed proficiency in managing databases, including inserting, updating, and deleting records, handling constraints, relating data tables, and utilizing advanced SQL features like triggers, sequences, variables, and indexes.

I used MySQL and Tableau to complete assignments, which improved my data analysis and visualization skills. I wrote efficient queries, managed complex joins, and used aggregate functions to answer business questions. This experience built my confidence in querying databases and developing business intuition through big data tasks.
