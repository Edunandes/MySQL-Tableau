I learned SQL and database management through the "MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence" course on Udemy by 365 Careers. The course had structured lessons and four important tasks that helped shape my database project. I gained practical skills in creating, designing, and operating SQL databases using MySQL.

I used MySQL and Tableau to complete assignments, which improved my data analysis and visualization skills. I learned how to manage databases by inserting, updating, and deleting records, handling constraints, relating data tables, and using advanced SQL features like triggers, sequences, variables, and indexes.

I wrote efficient queries, managed complex joins, and used aggregate functions to answer business questions. The hands-on practice helped me feel confident in querying databases and developing business intuition through big data tasks.
