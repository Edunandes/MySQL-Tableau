In this project, I created the database based on what I learned from the "MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence" course on Udemy. The lessons and techniques from the 365 Careers course were crucial in shaping how the database works.

The course provided a clear structure for using MySQL in data analytics and business intelligence. It included four detailed tasks that were key learning points for me. These tasks helped me understand database management and use, forming the basis for my database project.

While working on these tasks, I used both MySQL and Tableau. This combination helped me complete the assignments successfully. By integrating these technologies, I improved my skills in data analysis and visualization, making my database implementation more effective.
