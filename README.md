# Project 1 MySQL
Relationship Between Female &amp; Male Employees 

In this endeavor, the database implementation draws its foundation from the comprehensive insights furnished by the "MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence" course, accessible through the esteemed educational platform, Udemy. The knowledge and techniques gleaned from the 365 Careers course have been instrumental in shaping the database's structure and functionality.

Through the course, a structured framework for harnessing the power of MySQL in the realms of data analytics and business intelligence was meticulously laid out. Among its offerings were four intricately detailed tasks that served as pivotal learning points. These tasks not only enriched the understanding of database management and utilization but also laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of the database implementation.

In our journey through these tasks, we harnessed the combined power of MySQL and Tableau. This dynamic duo of technologies amplified our ability to complete the assignments successfully. Through thoughtful integration, we embraced the strengths of both MySQL and Tableau, bolstering our skills in data analysis and visualization, and reinforcing the practical aspects of database implementation.
